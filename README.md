# reprap_design

This is a collection of all the files that I used in order to design my own 3D printer. 

Based on the popular Kossel designs. I basically wanted something similar to a Kossel mini, but in a larger format.  Apposed to trying to retrofit a mini with larger pieces to make it work.  I decided to start from scratch.  This is a collection of that work.

The design is done in solidworks.
